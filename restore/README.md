# Restore directory

This is a part of the joomla-kickstart docker image. Any files here
will be copied to /var/www/html in the container.

Typically you would place the backup files from an Akeeba backup
here. Spin up the container and navigate to kickstart.php, select the
appropriate backup and continue through the Kickstart wizard.
